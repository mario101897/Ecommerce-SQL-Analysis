## The Learning Journey

When I started this project, my knowledge of SQL was fairly basic. I could write simple queries and perform straightforward analyses. However, I wanted to challenge myself to learn more advanced techniques and apply them in a real-world context.

### The Process
1. **Learning from Various Resources**: 
   - I watched tutorials on YouTube, especially those that focused on SQL for data analytics.
   - I explored open-source projects on GitHub, observing how others structured their queries and documented their work.
   - I experimented with SQL queries on sample datasets to build my confidence.

2. **Getting Help and Guidance**:
   - Whenever I encountered roadblocks, I turned to ChatGPT for guidance. Whether it was debugging a query or understanding a new concept, it was like having a coding mentor on hand.
   - Online forums and blogs were also incredibly helpful for resolving specific issues.

3. **Iterative Development**:
   - I didn’t aim for perfection in the first attempt. Instead, I continuously refined my queries and interpretations based on feedback and new learnings.

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding how to efficiently join multiple tables without compromising query performance was initially tricky. I had to spend time learning about indexing and query optimization.
- Writing queries that not only worked but also provided meaningful insights required a shift in mindset from “just getting results” to “getting the right results.”
- Documentation was another area of focus. I wanted my work to be clear and accessible, both for others and for future reference.

## Key Takeaways
- **SQL as a Tool for Storytelling**: This project showed me that SQL isn’t just about pulling numbers from a database; it’s about creating a narrative from data.
- **The Value of Iteration**: By revisiting and refining my queries, I not only improved the results but also deepened my understanding of SQL.
- **The Importance of Sharing Work**: Putting this project on GitHub isn’t just about showcasing my skills—it’s about contributing to the learning community that helped me get here.
